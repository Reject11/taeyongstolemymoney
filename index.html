									I sell WW.<br>
									I will send you a packaging proof and sending proof (I sometimes forget to send it but always make one. Please just write me if I forgot to send it to you!).<br>
									<b>If the post lose the letter/pakage I'm not reponsible.</b><br>
									I only accept Paypal or Wise.<br>
									If you want to pay with g&s you have to cover the fees and get tracked shipping.<br>
									If you paid with g&s and either did't choose tracked shipping and/or didn't cover the fees you have to pay for tracked shipping/send the missing amount. <br>
									Since this is a private sale: no refund, no warranty, no guarantee and no exchange.

									<h5>Shipping Info</h5>
									If I send your letter and have a proof that I did hand it to the delivery service I'm not responsible if it gets lost.<br>
									If the post office loses it then they are responsible.<br>
									I will try all I can to get in contact with them and get a refund (if it was insured) but if I don't get money from them I will not refund you from my money.<br>
									<br>
									Shipping in Germany starts at 1€ for PCs and 1,60€ for bigger items.<br>
									<br>
									Shipping International starts at 1,70€ for PCs and 3,70€ for bigger items.<br>
									<br>
									If the shipping goes outside of the European Union everything that is thicker then a postcard or PC has to be shipped as a package because of customs! <br>
									If you are not sure if that's the case for an item you're interested in don't hesitate to DM me. <br>
									<br>
									If you buy something from me I will let you know the shipping options and prices you can choose from.<br>
									If you want your items insured please let me know so that I can check for that.<br>
									<br>
									I don't have fixed shipping days!<br>
									Mostly I send on the weekend.<br>
									I try to send everything as soon as possible but send at least after around 2 weeks.<br>
									Standard, tracked letters and packages can be send on different days since I have to different options to send them.<br>

							</h5>
							<br>
							<div>
								<h4>GO Information</h4>
								<p>
									<h4>General information:</h4>
									For every GO I will create a Instagram group chat.<br>
									I will share all updates I get in the group chat and you can always check for the current staus at my notion list/masterlist.<br>
									If you want updates in between feel free to always ask me.<br>
									If the post don't say anything else I will do member sorting for random PCs.<br>
									<b>No Backout!</b><br>
									If you don't pay or fill out forms until the deadlines I will resell "your" item after a reminder by DM!<br>
									I can't guarantee that the GO package from my supplier to me has the full value on it.<br>
									So if it gets lost (never happend before) I will most likely not be able to fully refund you.<br>
									<br>
									<h5>Member Claims</h5>
									If I do member claims it's for shops that say they will send out full sets when you order the amount of albums you need for a Set. <br>
									(Example: NCT Dream - 7 Albums, Ateez - 8 Albums, etc.) <br>
									It can still happen that I don't receive a full set. If that's the case I will include the POBs in the Sorting!<br>
									<br>
									<h5>Packaging Fees:</h5>
									For all GOs I take a small packaging Fee.
									<ul>
										<li>Small letters: 0,60€</li>
										<li>Medium letters: 0,80€</li>
										<li>Lager letters: 0,90€</li>
										<li>Package: depending on size and packaging</li>
										<li>Each fee includes one toploader, every additional one: 0,15€</li>
									</ul>
									Depending on the GO they can be higher.<br>
									If you have any questions about it don't hesitate to DM me.

									<br>
									<br>
									<h4>Shipping the GO:</h4>
									<br>
									Around the time that the GO items are send I will send you an address form so that I can finish the packaging fast.<br>
									<br>
									As soon as I have your items packed I will send you an address proof and let you know the shipping options you have.<br>
									<br>
									<h5>Shipping with tracking:</h5>
									For letters I will send you a picture of the letter with your address and the stamp with the tracking number.<br>
									For packages I will only send you your tracking number since your address will be visible in the tracking.<br>
									<br>
									<h5>Shipping without tracking:</h5>
									I mostly have over 20 letters to be send at the same time so I will not take a video.<br>
									If you don't trust me with sending your items wothout a proof please choose an option with tracking or don't join.<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h4>Member sorting:</h4>
									<h6>!Changed System for all new GOs starting from 31.08.2023!</h6>
									All GOs with random PCs will have member sorting unless it's stated otherwise!<br>
									After the GO is orders I will send different options in the group chat where you can vote for a date and time when I will drop the sorting form. The option with the most votes will win.<br>
									On the chosen time I will drop the sorting form so that all of you have the same chance to get their member wishes.<br>
									<br>
									For the sorting I will use the system fcfs (first come first served). <br>
									That means that I check for your wishes in the order you filled out the form.<br>
									So I will start with the first person based on timestamps and give you the first wish that I have members available from.<br>
									Then the second person, etc.<br>
									<br>
									So as faster you are with filling out the form as higher is your chance to get the member you hope for.<br>

								<h5>Christmas Time</h5>
								<p>
									Between 16.12. and 05.01. I only send out your stuff at your own risk!<br>
									I'm doing that because of the higher risk of missing letters during Christmas (mostly only Standard and Prio (Germany only) since it's similar to Standard).<br>
									For Tracked Shipping everything should be fine but you can still choose if I send it or keep it.<br>
									If you don't want your stuff shipped in that time I will keep your stuff and send it out in january.<br>
									But I will already collect Shipping from you to be able to ship out directly in January.
